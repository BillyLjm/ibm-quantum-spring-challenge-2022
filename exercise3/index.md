A closed quantum many-body system initialized in a non-equilibrium will reach the equilibrium state, refereed to as thermalization, under its own dynamics. This behaviour is as a result of the laws of statistical mechanics, and analogous to a hot cup of coffee cooling down to the surrounding temperature if left unattended. However, the presence of lattice disorder prevents the system from evolving into an ergodic thermalized state. This interplay between disorder and particle interaction results in many-body localization (MBL), and it allows the system to retain a memory of its initial condition at all times.
